"""Tile selection for the RDNA3 WMMA GEMM.

``rdna3_f16_gemm`` builds whatever tile it is handed and defaults to 128x128x32.
That tile is right once the problem fills the grid, but it cuts only 4
workgroups at 256x256 and 16 at 512x512, so on a 96-CU part most CUs idle no
matter how good the inner loop is. Choosing the tile from the shape is worth up
to 3.0x there, and this module owns that decision in two layers:

  * ``pick_tile`` — a heuristic fitted to a sweep of every feasible tile on 27
    shapes. It needs no GPU and no measurement, and it is what a call resolves
    to with nothing configured, so the wrapper benchmarks nothing by default.
  * the shared autotuner — ``FLYDSL_AUTOTUNE=1`` sweeps ``feasible_tiles`` for
    real on the GPU in hand, and the result can be frozen into an offline
    artifact so other machines with the same device fingerprint skip the search.

The second layer earns its keep mainly where the first cannot reach: ``NUM_CU``
is hard-coded for gfx1100, so the thresholds do not transfer to a gfx11 part
with a different CU count, and shapes outside the fitted set are extrapolation.
It is also the least settled part of this — see ``_graph_bench`` for why its
verdict on the shortest kernels should not be taken at face value. The default
path does not benchmark and is unaffected.

The tile is not a Constexpr argument of one compiled entry point: it decides the
block shape, the wave grid and the LDS budget, so each candidate is a separate
module. The dispatcher below therefore takes the tile as ordinary keyword
arguments and looks the built module up in a cache, the same shape of
indirection ``conv3d_implicit_autotune`` uses.

    Measured on gfx1100 it is the fastest tile on 16 of the 27 shapes and holds

    covering tile cost up to 37% (1664x1664x1024) and averaged 6.5%.

    Four exceptions, in order. The first is the widest tile, and it is about

    ``(BM + BN) / (BM * BN)`` of A and B per output, so 256x256 moves half what

    The mixed tiles are never the answer. 128x256 was fastest on none of the 12
    shapes swept and 256x128 was last or next to last on all of them, so the
    choice is only ever 128x128 against 256x256, and neither mixed tile is
    reachable from here any more.

    What decides between the two is not the traffic ratio, which never moves:
    holding 88 TFLOP/s needs 1.375 TB/s at 128x128 and 688 GB/s at 256x256
    whatever the shape. What moves is how much of that the 96 MB of Infinity
    Cache absorbs. While the footprint fits, 128x128 sustains 1.37 TB/s of
    operand traffic and its finer grid wins outright -- 32% at 2048 square, still
    8% at 4096. Once it does not fit, 128x128 saturates at that same 1.32-1.37
    TB/s and 256x256 takes over, by 4% at 8192 square. Between roughly 2000 and
    4000 workgroups' worth of 128x128 tiles the two land within 0.3% of each
    other and the threshold below is arbitrary.

      * 256x256x32 once the grid is worth ~5 workgroups per CU. Only reachable
        unpadded; see _TILE_OPTS for why that drags the scheduling hints with it.
      * 128x128x32 once the grid is worth at least ~2.5 workgroups per CU. Its
        compute intensity wins outright there, by 5-11% over 64x64x64. Whatever
        can run 128x256 can run this, so dropping that tile strands nothing.
      * 128x64x32 (small-K ladder only) when it lands near one workgroup per CU.
        That is the narrow band around 1024x1024, where it leads by 13-28%.
      * 32x32x64 when 64x64x64 cannot fill a quarter of the machine and K is
        long enough for the idle CUs to dominate: 256x256x4096, worth 23%.

    Against the per-shape fastest tile the small-tile half of this averages 0.6%,
    worst case 8.1% at 1152x1152x1024, where 128x128x32's grid happens to land
    well. The wide-tile half is within 0.3% on all 12 shapes it was fitted to,
    and dropping 128x256 moved 15 shapes by a mean of 1.020x and a worst of
    1.009x with nothing behind, 8 of them outside the fitted set.
