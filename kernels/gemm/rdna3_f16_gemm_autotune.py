"""Tile selection for the RDNA3 WMMA GEMM.

``rdna3_f16_gemm`` builds whatever tile it is handed and defaults to 128x128x32.
That tile is right once the problem fills the grid, but it cuts only 4
workgroups at 256x256 and 16 at 512x512, so on a 96-CU part most CUs idle no
matter how good the inner loop is. Choosing the tile from the shape is worth up
to 3.0x there, and this module owns that decision in two layers:

  * ``pick_tile`` — a heuristic fitted to a sweep of every feasible tile on 27
    shapes. It needs no GPU and no measurement, and it is what a call resolves
    to with nothing configured, so the wrapper benchmarks nothing by default.
  * the shared autotuner — ``FLYDSL_AUTOTUNE=1`` sweeps ``feasible_tiles`` for
    real on the GPU in hand, and the result can be frozen into an offline
    artifact so other machines with the same device fingerprint skip the search.

The second layer earns its keep mainly where the first cannot reach: ``NUM_CU``
is hard-coded for gfx1100, so the thresholds do not transfer to a gfx11 part
with a different CU count, and shapes outside the fitted set are extrapolation.
It is also the least settled part of this — see ``_graph_bench`` for why its
verdict on the shortest kernels should not be taken at face value. The default
path does not benchmark and is unaffected.

The tile is not a Constexpr argument of one compiled entry point: it decides the
block shape, the wave grid and the LDS budget, so each candidate is a separate
module. The dispatcher below therefore takes the tile as ordinary keyword
arguments and looks the built module up in a cache, the same shape of
indirection ``conv3d_implicit_autotune`` uses.

def pick_tile(M, N, K):
    """Tile for this shape, fitted to a sweep of every ladder tile on 27 shapes.

    64x64x64 is the default rather than the widest tile that covers the machine.
    Measured on gfx1100 it is the fastest tile on 16 of the 27 shapes and holds
    50-59 TFLOP/s across the whole range, where 128x128x32 swings between 40 and
    72 depending on how its much coarser grid happens to land. Taking the widest
    covering tile cost up to 37% (1664x1664x1024) and averaged 6.5%.

    Five exceptions, in order. The first two are the wide tiles, and both are
    about operand traffic rather than about filling the machine: a tile reads
    ``(BM + BN) / (BM * BN)`` of A and B per output, so 128x256 moves a quarter
    less than 128x128 and 256x256 half as much again. Measured against rocBLAS TN
    in one thermal window, as a fraction of its time:

        square      4096   8192   12288  16384  20480
        128x128x32  0.805  0.903  0.919  0.875  0.829
        128x256x32  0.826  0.933  0.990  0.988  0.928
        256x256x32  0.797  0.913  0.979  1.012  0.999

    So the widest tile is not simply best: 256x256 needs roughly 32 workgroups per
    CU before its traffic saving outweighs how coarsely its grid lands, and below
    that 128x256 leads. Above it the order reverses and stays reversed, because
    128x256 is the one that starts falling off as the footprint grows.

      * 256x256x32 once the grid is worth ~32 workgroups per CU. Only reachable
        unpadded; see _TILE_OPTS for why that drags the scheduling hints with it.
      * 128x256x32 from ~4 workgroups per CU up. Never behind 128x128x32 anywhere
        it applies, by 2-11%.
      * 128x128x32 once the grid is worth at least ~2.5 workgroups per CU. Its
        compute intensity wins outright there, by 5-11% over 64x64x64.
      * 128x64x32 (small-K ladder only) when it lands near one workgroup per CU.
        That is the narrow band around 1024x1024, where it leads by 13-28%.
      * 32x32x64 when 64x64x64 cannot fill a quarter of the machine and K is
        long enough for the idle CUs to dominate: 256x256x4096, worth 23%.

    Against the per-shape fastest tile this averages 0.6%, worst case 8.1% at
    1152x1152x1024, where 128x128x32's grid happens to land well.
